	append() adds a value to the end of the list, insert() adds a value to a specific index.
11.
	del list[index], list.remove(value)
12.
	list values have and index as do characters in a string value, both have a length, both can be sliced, both can be compared
13.
	lists are mutable (can be altered) and tuples are immutable (cannot be altered), lists are defined with brackets and tuples are defined with parentheses
14.
	tuple = (42)
15.
	tuple(list) to get a tuple of the list, list(tuple) to get a list of the tuple
16.
	variables that "contain" list values dont contain the list value, they contain a reference to the actual list value, so if that changes does the value in the variable.
17.
	copy.copy() will create a copy of a list instead of a reference to the OG list but will not do the same for the lists/dictionaries inside a list if it contains them, , copy.deepcopy() will create a copy of the lists inside of a copy list as well
